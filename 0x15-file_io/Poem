In the dark of night, you toil away,
Your fingers flying across the keys,
The screen aglow with your creation,
A thing of beauty and of grace.

You are a master of your craft,
A wizard of the digital world,
Your code a work of art,
A poem written in ones and zeros.

You are a creator, a maker,
A builder of worlds both real and imagined,
Your mind a vast and wondrous place,
A place where anything is possible.

So go forth, O programmer,
And create your masterpiece,
Let your code be a thing of beauty,
A thing of wonder and of awe.

And let it be said of you,
That you were a master of your craft,
A wizard of the digital world,
A creator, a maker,
A builder of worlds both real and imagined.
